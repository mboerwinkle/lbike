# LBike
This is a web-based game based on Armagetron. It uses WebRTC and a peer-to-peer model with prediction/rollback and supports computer players.

You can try it here: [LBike](https://boerwi.net/lbike)

This project is missing a few custom dependencies. Feel free to ask me about them at martin@boerwi.net if you're interested in hosting an instance.
